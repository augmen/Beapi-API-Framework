# api-framework

My apologies for making this repository private but after much debate and after TWO SpringOne talks now with MASSIVE anger, confusion from my 'peers', I'm not sharing my code anymore.

I sat down for about 3 hours sharing my idea with Guillaume Laforge this week who was very helpful and understood alot of what I was doing and I explained the problems that I had with the Groovy/Grails/Java community. I told him about behaviour I get from contributors, ex-contributors, framework maintainers... and even stated that alot of it was my fault do to trying to avoid confusion because I KNOW my subject matter is complex.

I have been approached by Mashery, VMWare R&D, Netflix, Apple, Paypal, Amazon (alot of these several times) and given onsite demos at them with incredible reviews. But when I talk about this, I get responses like this from my peers similar to this:

And this isn't the first time, this is only the last straw of responses from developers who choose not to listen, not to contribute to the conversation and not to have a logical conversation on the merits and ideas of a concepts value.

As such, I'm not throwing my 'pearls before swine' anymore. I asked this to Guillaume with tears in my eyes because I truly want to contribute to the community and today I got a response from someone I know and admire who said he just didn't care if people were calling me a liar and didn't want to be part of the conversation.

As such, I'm removing myself from the conversation. This is not a rage quit (as some people have stated) as I tried to give it another shot and honestly had an face-to-face conversation with several people in the community who stated that I am in a tough position; enterprises understand and want it, developers don't understand it and so don't want nor care what I am doing.

I will offer this as a paid for product at a future date but this will not be open source.

I apologize sincerely to those who liked what I am doing and to those who I have talked to and found great value in it.

But I'm a bit of a sensitive developer and I provide a single point of attack for those who can't have civil, logical, merited conversations on software development. I can't promote industry change and being attacked at the same time without backing or support. 

So I wish you the best of luck.
