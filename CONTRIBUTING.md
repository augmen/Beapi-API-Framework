# How to contribute to Beapi Framework
**Did you find a bug?**

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include:
* title
* clear description
* java version
* operating system and version
* the expected behavior
* output of what is occurring

Please do not send a full stacktrace as we will request that via email if needed.

**Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**
Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

**Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will not be treated as critical but will be looked at in time.

**Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
Send us an email and chat with us. We are always looking for great ideas.

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

**Do you want to contribute to the Beapi documentation?**
Beapi is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

Thanks! heart heart heart
